The new skills that I have attained after the course is the syntax of HTML tags in general. It was quite difficult in
the beginning to gulp down the concepts and to understand why the tags behave the way they do. But with my perseverance
and excellent excellent coaching from Udacity, I was able to understand the exact semantics of the web.

The tree structure of the HTML elements in the browser is particularly intriguing. Initially, it didn't make sense to me as
to why the DOM elements would be laid out in a tree structure. But the more times I went through the course, the easier it
was to understand the complex and yet ultra-efficient tree rendering by the browsers.
